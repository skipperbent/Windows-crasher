# Windows-crasher 
In short; the app will open a new thread of itself upon launch, which will cause it to loop until Windows loses memory and ends up with the blue screen of death.. All this will happen while the user cant change focus away from the app itself - while playing annoying music and showing rainbows!

THIS APP WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANCES TO THE FILESYSTEM - AND SHOULD IN ANY WAY NOT BE MODIFIED TO DO SO!
